## **Introduction**

As technology becomes more integrated into our daily lives, understanding its effects on how we think and solve problems has become essential. Assistive technologies, like search engines and AI tools, are now widely used and can shape the way individuals tackle tasks. While past research has examined how these tools influence both performance and confidence, the results have been somewhat inconsistent. Some studies suggest that using these technologies can boost confidence, while others imply that depending on them might actually diminish cognitive self-esteem.

This study seeks to build on previous research by exploring how different types of assistive technologies affect cognitive confidence, self-esteem, and actual performance. We propose that participants using AI tools will report feeling more confident than those relying on traditional search engines or no technology at all. However, we anticipate that the type of technology wonâ€™t have a significant impact on cognitive self-esteem or overall performance.

## **Method**

**Participants**
This study involved 873 undergraduate psychology students, with a majority of 586 females. The average age of the participants was 19.53 years, though the standard deviation was not reported. These students, enrolled in a psychology course, took part in the study as a part of their regular tutorial activities. They were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups, each designed to evaluate the impact of different assistive technologies on cognitive performance and self-perception. The random assignment aimed to reduce potential biases and ensure comparability across the groups in terms of demographic and cognitive traits.

**Design**
The experiment used a between-subjects design, with participants randomly assigned to one of four conditions, each based on the type of assistive technology available to them. This approach was chosen to distinctly measure the effects of each technology on cognitive confidence, self-esteem, and performance. The four conditions were as follows:

- **Control**: Participants in this group did not use any assistive technology and were encouraged to guess if unsure of the quiz answers. This served as a baseline to compare the other conditions.
- **Google Search (Phone)**: Participants in this condition used Google search on their smartphones, simulating a common scenario where people use their phones to look up information.
- **Bing Search (Laptop/Tablet)**: In this condition, participants used a laptop or tablet with the Bing search engine, included to compare the effects of different search engines and devices on cognitive performance.
- **AI Copilot (Laptop/Tablet)**: Participants were provided with an AI copilot tool on a laptop or tablet to explore how advanced assistive technology influences cognitive processes.

**Procedure**
The study was conducted in several stages. Initially, participants answered ten trivia questions and were immediately given the correct answers after each question, regardless of their responses. This immediate feedback aimed to equalize the information available to all participants before proceeding to the next stages. Following the trivia questions, participants rated their confidence in their ability to answer similar questions in the future without using assistive technology. This "Future Confidence" measure assessed how the use of assistive technology in each condition influenced their self-perceived cognitive abilities.

Next, participants completed a 14-item cognitive self-esteem scale, measuring their overall perceptions of cognitive abilities, including memory, problem-solving, and critical thinking. This scale was designed to detect any changes in self-esteem resulting from the different assistive technologies used.

Finally, participants retook the same ten trivia questions, this time in a multiple-choice format without any access to assistive technology. This final quiz aimed to evaluate knowledge retention and the impact of prior technology use on actual performance when technology was no longer available.

## **Results**

The study's results revealed that the type of assistive technology used had a significant impact on participants' confidence in their ability to answer future questions. Specifically, those who used the AI copilot reported the highest level of future confidence ( $M=4.88$ ), followed by participants who used Bing $(M=4.57)$, Google $(M=4.25)$, and no technology ( $M=3.60$ ). Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in confidence across all pairwise comparisons: Control vs. Phone ( $p=0.009$ ), Phone vs. Bing ( $p=0.014$ ), and Bing vs. AI ( $p=0.010$ ).

In contrast, cognitive self-esteem scores showed no significant variation across the different conditions. The mean scores were 3.60 for the Control group, 3.56 for the Phone group, 3.64 for the Bing group, and 3.60 for the AI group. With p-values above 0.70 for all comparisons, there were no significant differences in cognitive self-esteem among the four groups.

Similarly, quiz performance, as measured by the number of correct answers out of ten, did not significantly differ between the groups. The Control condition had a mean score of 9.92, the Phone condition scored 9.95, Bing users had 9.91, and AI users had 9.86. Statistical comparisons showed no significant differences in quiz performance, with all p-values greater than 0.67.

These findings suggest that while assistive technologies can enhance participants' confidence, they do not appear to significantly affect cognitive self-esteem or actual quiz performance.

## **Discussion**

The findings from this study indicate that using assistive technologies, particularly AI, significantly boosts individuals' confidence in their ability to perform similar tasks in the future. This is consistent with previous research suggesting that technology can serve as a confidence enhancer, providing users with a sense of increased capability. However, the study also highlights that this boost in confidence does not translate into actual improvements in cognitive self-esteem or performance. Despite feeling more confident, participants using advanced technologies like AI did not perform better on quizzes or report a more positive assessment of their cognitive abilities compared to those who used less sophisticated tools or none at all.

The lack of significant changes in cognitive self-esteem and quiz performance suggests that participants may become reliant on assistive technologies without truly developing their cognitive skills. This raises concerns about the potential long-term effects of such dependence. If individuals consistently rely on these tools, they might miss opportunities to enhance their intrinsic problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills. Future research should explore whether prolonged and repeated use of assistive technologies could eventually lead to shifts in cognitive self-esteem and whether these changes might ultimately impact performance when the technology is no longer available.

In summary, while assistive technologies like AI can increase confidence, they do not seem to enhance cognitive self-esteem or actual performance. This underscores the need for a balanced approach to technology use, where the benefits of increased confidence are carefully weighed against the importance of developing and maintaining core cognitive skills.
